-In the init.txt file put the term for which you want to check on the first line and put the class names you want on the subsequent lines

-For example if you wanted to check Taekwondo for the spring 2020 semester your init.tx would look like this

-In the occreds.py file you simply put your username and password as variables in the following format


USERNAME = 'your-username'

Make sure to have geckodriver.exe installed in your working directory if on windows

This only works on windows but you can change the geckodriver variable to make it work on any other os.


Hope you enjoy!
